Extensions
==========

Loopa supports extensions for custom reporting, load shapes, and event handling.

To create an extension:

- Implement your logic in a Python module
- Register it with loopa's dispatcher or event system
- Share your extension with the community

See docs/extending-loopa.rst for more details.
