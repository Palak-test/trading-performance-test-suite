Extending Loopa
===============

Loopa is designed to be extensible. You can add custom event handlers, load shapes, and reporting modules.

To extend loopa:

- Create a new Python module
- Register your extension with the dispatcher or event system
- Document your extension for others

See examples/ for sample extensions.
